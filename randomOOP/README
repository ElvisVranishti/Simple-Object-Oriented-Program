This is a basic OOP project that I created from scratch for a java programming school project. 
This project showcases my understanding of OOP concepts such as abstraction, interfaces, and working with many classes and objects.

The main purpose of this project is to create an abstract class for the children classes to extend on. It also takes abstract methods that can be used in different
classes so that we don't have to create the same methods for all the differente classes.

There is also a basic interface method that implementing child classes can utilize.

If I had more time to work on this project, I would add user feedback to control the outcome of the program. This project could also be scaled to
give users the prices for taxis in their area, if more time was spent on it.
